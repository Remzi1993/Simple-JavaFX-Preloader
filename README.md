# Simple JavaFX preloader example
A very simple JavaFX preloader example using the built-in JavaFX preloader API by extending the Preloader class. Code is based on examples shown here: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/deployment/preloaders.htm


This is code is so basic that it shouldn't be copyrightable but I added an open source license nonetheless so everyone can use it without any license paranoia. I hope this helps others. I have also posted this on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/74279131/10686802
